Simple Go server to get AniList details, relying on GraphQL.

(This project was made to learn Go, so I decided to rewrite some of my Node.js APIs in Go.)

# Usage
Add your anilist user ID in the request: `https://api.kuuhaku.space/anilist/{id}`

Example:

```py
https://api.kuuhaku.space/anilist/5631742
```
